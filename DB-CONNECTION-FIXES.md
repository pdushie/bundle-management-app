# Database Connection Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. Fixed the error `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND test-db` by modifying the API routes to use the Neon client instead of direct pg Pool connections.

2. Updated the `db.ts` file to handle incorrect DATABASE_URL format and provide a mock database client in development mode.

3. Created utility functions in `dbUtils.ts` for consistent database error handling across the application.

4. Updated `.env.example` to show the correct format for the DATABASE_URL.

## What Was Changed

1. `src/lib/db.ts`: Added validation for DATABASE_URL format and implemented a mock client for development mode.

2. `src/lib/dbUtils.ts`: Added helper functions for consistent database operations with better error handling.

3. API Routes:
   - Updated `src/app/api/history/load/route.ts` to use neonClient
   - Updated `src/app/api/history/save/route.ts` to use neonClient
   - Made both routes resilient to database connection errors

4. Environment Files:
   - Updated `.env.example` to include database configuration examples
   - Created `.env.development` with proper DATABASE_URL format for development

## Steps to Set Up Database Connection

1. Create a `.env.local` file with your Neon database credentials:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/dbname
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

2. Make sure your Neon database is properly configured and accessible.

3. If you're in development mode and don't have a database connection, the application will now use a mock database client that returns empty results instead of crashing.

## Potential Additional Steps

More API routes may need to be updated to use the new neonClient approach:
- src/app/api/admin/pending-users/route.ts
- src/app/api/admin/stats/route.ts
- And others listed in the grep search results

These can be updated using the same pattern as the history routes.
