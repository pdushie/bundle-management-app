# Billing Calculation Fix - October 26, 2025

## Issue Summary
The user `boadu.godfred419@gmail.com` reported that the billing amount shown in the **Accounting > User billing tab** was incorrect, displaying **GHS 70,629.90** instead of the expected amount.

## Root Cause Analysis
After detailed investigation, the issue was identified in the `/api/admin/accounting/user-bill/route.ts` endpoint:

### The Problem
The API was **missing the user filter** in the database query, causing it to return billing data for **ALL USERS** on the specified date instead of just the selected user.

### Original Broken Query (Lines 58-65)
```typescript
const userOrders = await db
  .select()
  .from(ordersTable)
  .where(
    and(
      sql`timestamp >= ${startTimestamp} AND timestamp <= ${endTimestamp}`,
      eq(ordersTable.date, date)
      // ❌ MISSING: User filter!
    )
  )
```

### Database Investigation Results
- **User**: `boadu.godfred419@gmail.com` (ID: 21)
- **Date**: 2025-10-26
- **User's actual orders**: 4 orders totaling **$684.40**
- **All users' orders**: 20 orders totaling **$70,629.90**

#### Breakdown by User:
- `boadu.godfred419@gmail.com`: 4 orders, **$684.40**
- `godfredyeleboue@gmail.com`: 12 orders, **$2,313.50**  
- `prnkhay@gmail.com`: 1 order, **$28,807.50**
- `HNDRX240@gmail.com`: 3 orders, **$38,824.50**
- **Total**: **$70,629.90** ← This was being incorrectly shown

## The Fix
The issue was that the `orders` table uses `user_email` for user identification (the `user_id` field is null for all records). The fix involved:

1. **Fetch user details first** to get the email address
2. **Filter by `user_email`** instead of `user_id`

### Fixed Query (Lines 58-71)
```typescript
// Get user details first to get their email for filtering orders
const userDetailsResult = await db!.execute(sql`
  SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE id = ${userIdInt} LIMIT 1
`);

const user = userDetails[0];
const userEmail = user.email;

// Query orders filtering by user_email
const userOrders = await db
  .select()
  .from(ordersTable)
  .where(
    and(
      sql`timestamp >= ${startTimestamp} AND timestamp <= ${endTimestamp}`,
      eq(ordersTable.date, date),
      eq(ordersTable.userEmail, userEmail) // ✅ FIXED: Filter by user email
    )
  )
```

## Verification
After applying the fix:
- **Before**: API returned **$70,629.90** (all users)
- **After**: API returns **$684.40** (specific user only)
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

## Files Modified
- `src/app/api/admin/accounting/user-bill/route.ts` - Fixed user filtering logic
- `src/app/api/debug/user-billing/route.ts` - Fixed TypeScript errors

## Testing
The fix was validated using direct database queries confirming:
1. User `boadu.godfred419@gmail.com` has exactly 4 processed orders on 2025-10-26
2. Total cost is $684.40 for 188GB of data
3. API now correctly filters and returns only this user's data

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Users will now see accurate billing amounts in the Accounting section
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents billing confusion and ensures accurate financial reporting
- **System Reliability**: Eliminates a critical bug that could affect all user billing queries
